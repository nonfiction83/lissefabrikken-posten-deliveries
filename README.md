# posten-delivery-checker

## Introduction
After 2020 Posten only delivers post every other day. They provide a web site, but no proper API: https://www.posten.no/levering-av-post-2020. This application aims to serve a simple web site for use on information screens to show scheduled post deliveries for a given postal code in Norway. 

This app fetches the required information and serves a formatted HTML page, customized for the authors use case. Feel free to modify the output to your liking if you fork the repo.

## Acknowledgment
Special thanks to a good friend for providing most of the code and letting me tweak it further! üëè
